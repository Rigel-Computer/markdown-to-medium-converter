# Markdown-to-Medium Converter

> 🚀 **A robust Markdown-to-Medium converter** — handles complex code blocks, preserves formatting, and works with all programming languages.

This project offers a browser-based HTML tool to convert standard Markdown into clean, Medium.com-compatible HTML — with accurate spacing, styling, and copy behavior.

🗣 **Language availability:**

-  🇩🇪 German UI version: `markdown-to-medium_DE.html`
-  🇬🇧 English UI version: `markdown-to-medium_EN.html`

## 🎯 Why This Tool is Special

**If you've ever tried to paste Markdown with code blocks into Medium, you know the pain:**

-  ❌ Code blocks get split into multiple sections
-  ❌ Empty lines disappear
-  ❌ Headlines inside code become actual headings
-  ❌ Lists inside code become actual bullet points
-  ❌ Complex technical content becomes a formatting nightmare

**This tool solves ALL of these problems!** 🎉

### 🏆 What Makes This Different

**✅ Advanced Code Block Protection**

-  Preserves empty lines in code blocks (crucial for YAML, Docker Compose, etc.)
-  Handles headlines (`### Step 1`) inside code without breaking formatting
-  Protects list symbols (`- item`) inside code from becoming actual lists
-  Works with **ALL programming languages** (bash, python, yaml, javascript, etc.)
-  Supports both named code blocks (`` yaml`) and unnamed ones ( ``)

**✅ Perfect Medium Integration**

-  Clean HTML output that Medium loves
-  No spacing issues after headings
-  Optimized copy-paste behavior
-  Live preview shows exactly what Medium will display

**✅ Battle-Tested Reliability**

-  Handles complex technical documentation
-  Works with mixed content (code + text + images)
-  Robust against edge cases that break other converters
